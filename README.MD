# My First MVC

Based on this repository: [simple-php-mvc-starter](https://github.com/maheshsamudra/simple-php-mvc-starter), my goal with this project is:

- [ ] Add at least two database connections;
- [ ] Implement assets layer and compilation;
- [ ] Add a simple documentation with a diagram of classes;

## To execute:

 1. Clone the project;
 2. `composer dump-autoload`;
 3. `php -S localhost:8001 -t public`
